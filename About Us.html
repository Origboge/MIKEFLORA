            <p data-aos="fade-right"> A family where learning began in 2007, after many years of teaching and nurturing young minds, Mrs. Oshodi decided to create something special. She envisioned a school built on the strong foundation of family and where every child could blossom
                and grow. And so, right here in Oba Afunbiowo Estate, Akure, our school was born! We weren't just any school; we were a place where students wouldn't just learn from textbooks, but from a caring community. Think of our school as a big,
                loving family. Mrs. Oshodi, wanted to create a space where every child felt cherished and supported. Our teachers are like caring uncles and aunts, always there to guide you on your learning journey.
